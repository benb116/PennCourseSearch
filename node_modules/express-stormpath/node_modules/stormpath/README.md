## Install

```bash
npm install stormpath
```


## Quickstart

The Quickstart is on the front page of the [Stormpath Node.js API Documentation](http://docs.stormpath.com/nodejs/api).


## Building

This code does not require a build step and can be immediately required by your node application after installed from npm (see above).

You may run the unit tests with the grunt command:

```bash
grunt
```

Or the integration tests (which assume an apikey file in `~/.stormpath`):

```bash
grunt it
```

To build the documentation, you need to enter the `docs` directory, then run:

```console
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt
```

The `grunt serve` command will build and serve the docs locally on port 9000.  You can
view the HTML documentation by visiting http://localhost:9000/home in your browser.
