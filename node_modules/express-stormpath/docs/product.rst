Product Guide
=============

This product guide covers more advanced Express-Stormpath usage.  You can
selectively jump around from topic-to-topic to discover all the neat features
that Express-Stormpath provides!


Configuration
-------------

There are two ways to configure Express-Stormpath -- you can list all of your
settings manually when initializing the Stormpath middleware, or you can specify
your settings via environment variables.

If you want to specify settings via middleware, you can do so by specifying
their names like so::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      secretKey: 'blah',
      enableHttps: false,
    }));

As an alternative, you could specify these settings via environment variables,
by using the same names, with a twist: each name must be in all caps, start with
'stormpath', and use underscores instead of spaces.

For instance, if I wanted to reproduce the above with environment variables, I
could define the following variables::

    $ export STORMPATH_SECRET_KEY=blah
    $ export STORMPATH_ENABLE_HTTPS=false

Then, when defining my middleware, I could simply write::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app));


Enforce User Authentication
---------------------------

Now that we've seen how easy it is to register, login, and logout users in your
Express app, let's see how simple it is to restrict views to logged-in users only.

Let's say you have a simple view which should only be accessible to users who
have logged in.  Below is a code sample which shows how easy it is to restrict
access to your view::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.get('/secret', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      res.send("If you're seeing this page, you must be logged in!");
    });


The ``loginRequired`` middleware makes enforcing user authentication extremely
simple.

If you try to visit the ``/secret`` URL and you're not logged in, you'll be
redirected to: ``/login?next=%2Fsecret``.  If you then enter your credentials
and log in -- you'll be immediately redirected back to the page you were trying
to access: ``/secret``.

As of Express-Stormpath **0.6.0**, there's now another middleware you can use
here: ``stormpath.authenticationRequired``.  It works *exactly* like
``stormpath.loginRequired``, but *also* accepts API authentication.

This is useful if you'd like to build a route which can be accessed both through
the browser using sessions, as well as via a REST API.


Enforce User Authorization
--------------------------

Stormpath supports extremely complex authorization rules.  This section aims to
provide a basic introduction to Express-Stormpath's authorization enforcement
(*this topic is covered in-depth later on*).

The main authorization resource in Stormpath is the ``Group``.  A Stormpath
Group is a named resource (*admins, developers, paid users, free users, etc.*)
which can be assigned to any number of user accounts.

Let's say you're building a site that has three tiers of users: free users, paid
users, and admins.  In this case, you'd want to create three Stormpath Groups:
``free users``, ``paid users``, and ``admins``.

If you visit your Stormpath Directory in the `Directory Dashboard`_, then
click the "Groups" tab, you can create your groups here, as well as assign users
to groups.

.. note::
    If you'd like to learn how to create groups pragmatically, you can look at
    our Node library's `createGroup`_ documentation.

Now that we've created our groups, and also added our user to the "free users"
group -- let's see how we can enforce different types of authorization on
our user using the ``groupsRequired`` middleware::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.get('/admins', stormpath.groupsRequired(['admins']), function(req, res) {
      res.send('If you can see this page, you must be in the `admins` group!');
    });

If a user tries to visit ``/admins``, they'll get redirected to the login page
and won't be able to access the view.

What if we wanted to build a view only accessible to users who are both free
users and admins?  In this case we could just list both required groups::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.get('/free_users_and_admins', stormpath.groupsRequired(['free users', 'admins']), function(req, res) {
      res.send('If you can see this page, you must be in the `free users` and `admins` group!');
    });

Now that you've seen how you can require a user to be a member of multiple
groups, let's take a look at how you can enforce selective group membership::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.get('/any_user', stormpath.groupsRequired(['free users', 'paid users', 'admins'], false), function(req, res) {
      res.send('If you can see this page, you must be in at least one of the specified groups!');
    });

The view above lists three groups, and sets the ``all`` parameter to ``false``
-- signifying that a user must be a member of **at least one** of the listed
groups in order to gain access.


Session Management
------------------

Express-Stormpath ships with a default, pre-configured session middleware by
default.  This middleware library, `client-sessions`_, is preconfigured for
security and statelessness.

If, for some reason, you'd like to store your session state in a database or
server of some kind, you can swap out the built-in session management middleware
with your own.

.. note::
    Express-Stormpath's session management will not interfere with any existing
    session middleware you might have.  The sessions that Stormpath uses are
    exclusively used for Stormpath purposes, so it's safe you create your own
    separate sessions.

    This works by utilizing the Express `router`_.

If you'd like to use your own session middleware, you can set it up during the
Stormpath middleware initialization.  The only requirement is that your request
key for the session is ``session``.

You can do it this way::

    var session = require('express-session');

    // In this example we'll store our session state in a Redis server.
    var RedisStore = require('connect-redis')(session);

    var sessionMiddleware = session({
      store: new RedisStore(options),
      secret: 'this is very secret',
    });

    // Enable your session middleware for your app.
    app.use(sessionMiddleware);

    // Initialize Stormpath, and have it use your session middleware instead of
    // it's own.
    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      sessionMiddleware: sessionMiddleware,
    }));

.. note::
    Substituting your own session middleware in for the default is most likely a
    security concern -- please only do this if you absolutely know what you're
    doing and are sure you need to do it!  If you're not sure, please contact us
    directly to figure it out: support@stormpath.com


Restrict Session Duration / Expiration
--------------------------------------

Another thing people commonly want to do is restrict how long a user can be
logged in without activity before being forced to log into their account again.

You can easily change the default session / cookie expiration by modifying the
``sessionDuration`` setting::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      sessionDuration: 1000 * 60 * 15, // Make sessions expire after 15 minutes.
    }));

By default, sessions will not expire for one month (*out of convenience*).

.. note::
    The ``sessionDuration`` setting expects an integer, which must be the number
    of **milliseconds** before the session will expire -- if you miscalculate
    this number, your sessions will expire very quickly!


Making Session Cookies Work on Subdomains
-----------------------------------------

If your application and users are going to be accessing multiple subdomains --
you will most likely want to provide a seamless user experience -- you don't
want to force users to log in each time they visit a new subdomain -- right?

In order to make this work, you need to modify the ``sessionDomain`` middleware
setting::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      sessionDomain: 'mysite.com', // Make the session cookie work on all mysite.com subdomains.
    }));

By default, sessions will *only* work on the subdomain in which the user
initially logged in.

.. note::
    If you explicitly set a domain as shown above -- things will NOT work
    locally.  Once you've set the domain option, users will only be able to log
    in when accessing that domain directly.


Enable Caching
--------------

The best kind of websites are fast websites.  As of version **0.1.5**,
Express-Stormpath includes built-in support for caching.  You can currently use
either:

- A local memory cache (*default*).
- A `memcached`_ cache.
- A `redis`_ cache.

All can be easily configured using configuration variables.

There are several configuration settings you can specify when initializing the
Stormpath middleware:

- ``cache`` - The type of cache to use: ``'memory'``, ``'memcached'``, or
  ``'redis'``).  Defaults to ``'memory'``.  If you want to use local memory as a
  cache, just set memory here and leave all other fields blank!
- ``cacheHost`` - The hostname of the cache (*ex: '127.0.0.1'*).
- ``cachePort`` - The port of the cache (*ex: 11211*).
- ``cacheTTL`` - The amount of time (*in seconds*) to cache resources before
  expiring them.  Defaults to ``300``.
- ``cacheTTI`` - If this amount of time has passed (*in seconds*) since a
  resource was last accessed, it will be expired.  Defaults to ``300``.
- ``cacheOptions`` - An object which holds additional configuration options for
  the cache (*like username, password, etc.*).

Here's an example showing how to enable caching for a memcached server that is
running locally with no username / password::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      cache: 'memcached',
      cacheHost: '127.0.0.1',
      cachePort: 11211,
    }));

Here's an example which shows how to enable caching for a redis server that is
running locally with a required password::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      cache: 'redis',
      cacheHost: '127.0.0.1',
      cachePort: 6379,
      cacheOptions: {
        auth_pass: 'xxx',
      },
    }));


Access User Data
----------------

Let's take a quick look at how we can access user data from a custom view.

Let's say we've defined a simple view that should simply display a user's email
address.  We can make use of the magical ``req.user`` context variable to
do this::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.get('/email', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      res.send('Your email address is:', req.user.email);
    });

The ``req.user`` context allows you to directly interact with the current
``user`` object.  This means you can perform *any* action on the ``user`` object
directly.

For more information on what you can do with a ``user`` object, please see
the Node library documentation: http://docs.stormpath.com/nodejs/api/account

Let's say you want to change a user's ``givenName`` (*first name*).  You could
easily accomplish this with the following code::

    // assuming we're inside of a request
    req.user.givenName = 'Randall';
    req.user.save(function(err) {
      if (!err) {
        console.log('User change saved successfully.');
      }
    });

As you can see above, you can directly modify ``user`` attributes, then
persist any changes by running ``req.user.save()``.


Handling Events
---------------

As of Express-Stormpath **0.2.8**, it is now possible to handle specific events!
This means you can run your own custom code when a specific event happens.

All supported events are listed below.


Post Registration
.................

Want to run some custom code after a user registers for your site?  If so, this
is the event you want to handle!

By defining a ``postRegistrationHandler`` you're able to do stuff like:

- Send a new user a welcome email.
- Generate API keys for all new users.
- Setup Stripe billing.
- etc.

To use a ``postRegistrationHandler``, you need to define your handler function
in the Stormpath middleware setup::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      postRegistrationHandler: function(account, res, next) {
        console.log('User:', account.email, 'just registered!');
        next();
      },
    }));

As you can see in the example above, the ``postRegistrationHandler`` function
takes in three parameters:

- ``account``: The new, successfully created, user account.
- ``res``: The Express response object.  This can be used to modify the HTTP
  response directly.
- ``next``: The callback to call when you're done doing whatever it is you want
  to do.  If you call this, execution will continue on normally.  If you don't
  call this, you're responsible for handling the response.

In the example below, we'll use the ``postRegistrationHandler`` to redirect the
user to a special page (*instead of the normal registration flow*)::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      postRegistrationHandler: function(account, res, next) {
        res.redirect(302, '/secretpage').end();
      },
    }));


Working With Custom User Data
-----------------------------

In addition to managing basic user fields, Stormpath also allows you to store
up to 10MB of JSON information with each user account!

Instead of defining a database table for users, and another database table for
user profile information -- with Stormpath, you don't need either!

Let's take a look at how easy it is to store custom data on a ``user``
model::

    // assuming we're inside of a request
    req.user.customData.somefield = 'somevalue';
    req.user.customData['anotherfield'] = {'json': 'data'};
    req.user.customData['woot'] = 10.202223;
    req.user.save();

    user.customData['woot'];
    // 10.202223

    delete user.customData['woot'];
    user.save(function(err, updatedUser) {
      if (!err) {
        updatedUser.customData.woot;
        // undefined
      }
    });

As you can see above -- storing custom information on a ``user`` account is
extremely simple!

Extra Context For Templates
------------------------------------

Your app might need to add custom data like analytics code to the templates. This
data will most likely change depending of the environment you are running on and you
can't hardcode it in the template.

To fix that you can pass extra context to Express-Stormpath like so::

    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      templateContext: {
        extraData: 'This is extra data.',
        googleAnalyticsID: 'UA-0000000-1',
        mixpanelID: '123456'
      }
    }));

And in each template, you'll have access to ``extraData`` and the other variables
you defined. Keep in mind that thosevalues might override the ones from 
Express-Stormpath. If you experience clashes, you might need to check your variable names first.


Automatic Expansion
-------------------

As of Express-Stormpath **0.4.3**, you can now take advantage of automatic
expansion.  Automatic expansion allows you to more easily work with user data.

Let's say you're working on an app which makes use of the ``customData``
property.  As mentioned in the previous section, you could always work with this
data in each route by requesting it like so::

    app.get('/', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      req.user.getCustomData(function(err, data) {
        res.json(data);
      });
    });

However -- this is a bit nasty, right?  If you know that you always want to use
``customData`` -- then having to repeatedly call ``req.user.getCustomData`` over
and over again is going to get boring!

With automatic expansion, you can pass in a configuration option when setting up
your middleware, and tell it you want a particular property to be expanded
automatically -- for instance::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      expandCustomData: true,
    });

Now, inside of *any* route, you could do the following::

    app.get('/', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      res.json(req.user.customData);
    });

As you can see above, by automatically expanding the ``customData`` property, it
means you don't have to make any additional Stormpath calls -- it will happen
automatically on each request!

You can expand any of the *"linked resources"* below:

- ``apiKeys`` - A user's API keys.
- ``customData`` - A user's custom data.
- ``directory`` - A user's directory data.
- ``groups`` - A user's group data.
- ``groupMemberships`` - A user's group membership data.
- ``providerData`` - A user's provider data (*for social login providers*).
- ``tenant`` - A user's tenant data.

Now, some of the linked resources above are simple JSON objects:

- ``customData``
- ``directory``
- ``providerData``
- ``tenant``

Each of the above objects contains some fields, and can be referenced like a
normal JSON object.

The other fields, however:

- ``apiKeys``
- ``groups``
- ``groupMemberships``

Are collections -- and they can't be queried in a single request.

Take ``groups``, for instance, if your account is a member of 1,000 groups, you
won't be able to squeeze all 1,000 groups into a single object (*it's just not
efficient*) -- so instead, you have to iterate over the collection.

Below is an example which shows how you can iterate over a collection resource
(*groups, in this case*)::

    app.get('/', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      req.user.groups.each(function(group, callback) {
        console.log('group:', group);
        callback();
      }, function() {
        res.send('Finished logging all groups to the console!')
      });
    });

Each collection resource has an ``each`` method which takes in two functions
with signature: ``function(data, callback), function()``.  The first function
will be called for each resource in the collection.  The second function will be
called when you've finished iterating through all of the available resources.

So, given the example above, we could just as easily iterate over all of a
user's ``apiKeys``::

    app.get('/', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      req.user.apiKeys.each(function(apiKey, callback) {
        console.log('apiKey:', apiKey);
        callback();
      }, function() {
        res.send('Finished logging all apiKeys to the console!')
      });
    });

Below is a full list of the available expansion options that you'll need to
enable in your middleware if you'd like to turn expansion on (*each field can be
enabled by setting its value to true*):

- ``expandApiKeys``
- ``expandCustomData``
- ``expandDirectory``
- ``expandGroups``
- ``expandGroupMemberships``
- ``expandProviderData``
- ``expandTenant``


API Authentication
------------------

In addition to handling user login, registration, etc. for web users -- you can
also use Stormpath to secure your REST API.

Typically, securing REST APIs is a lot of work:

- You need to assign users API keys.
- You need to cache the API keys for validation when users make requests
  (*nobody likes a slow API!*).
- You need to allow users to exchange their API keys for Oauth tokens (*if you
  want to support Oauth*).

With Stormpath, however, this process is greatly simplified.  Stormpath can
create API keys for your users, store them securely, and completely handle API
authentication / caching.


Create API Keys
...............

Before you can secure your REST API, you'll need to provision an API key pair
for one of your Stormpath users.

To do this (*assuming you're inside of an Express route*), you can call the
``createApiKey`` method on your user object like so::

    // Create an API key pair for the current user.
    app.post('/create', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      req.user.createApiKey(function(err, apiKey) {
        if (err) {
          res.json(503, { error: 'Something went wrong. Please try again.' });
        } else {
          res.json({ id: apiKey.id, secret: apiKey.secret });
        }
      });
    });

The above route will create a new API key for the logged in user, then return it
as JSON.  Each API key pair has two parts:

- ``id`` - An API key ID -- this is similar to a username.
- ``secret`` - An API key secret -- this is similar to a password.

Both the id and secret *must* be given to your user, as both will be needed for
API authentication.

Once you've created at least one API key pair for your user, you can then allow
this user to authenticate using their API keys against your API service.


Authenticating via Basic Auth
.............................

If you're building a REST API, the simplest way to secure your API is using HTTP
basic authentication.

Essentially what this means is that a developer will be able to access your API
by specifying their API key ID and secret when making requests to your API.

To allow a user to authenticate via basic authentication, all you need to use is
the ``apiAuthenticationRequired`` middleware in your route::

    // This API endpoint is *only* accessible to users with valid API keys.
    app.get('/me', stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired, function(req, res) {
      var user = req.user;
      res.json({
        givenName: user.givenName,
        surname: user.surname,
        email: user.email,
      });
    });

Now, let's see how a developer can successfully use this API endpoint defined
above.

First, we'll use the `curl`_ command to make an API request to this endpoint
*without specifying our API credentials*::

    $ curl -v http://localhost:3000/me
    {"error":"Invalid API credentials."}

As you can see above, by hitting the API endpoint with no credentials, a JSON
error is returned automatically (*along with an HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED status
code*).

Now, let's try this again by specifying our user's API credentials (*that we
generated in the previous section*)::

    $ curl -v --user id:secret http://localhost:3000/me
    {"givenName":"Randall","surname":"Degges","email":"r@rdegges.com"}

As you can see, by specifying my developer API credentials, I was able to
successfully authenticate against the REST API!

Using basic authentication, along with SSL, is an *excellent* way to secure
your REST API.


Authenticating via OAuth
........................

OAuth is another popular way to secure REST APIs.

The way OAuth works is as follows:

- You've built a REST API that you want to secure.
- You've got developer accounts, and each developer account has an API key
  pair.
- A developer makes an HTTP POST request to your API service at the URL
  ``/oauth``, and authenticates via HTTP basic authentication.
- If the request to ``/oauth`` was successful, an OAuth token will be returned
  to the developer.  This token is a long string that expires in a given amount
  of time (*by default, OAuth tokens expire after one hour*).
- After the developer has this OAuth token, they can use this to authenticate
  future API requests instead of using their API key directly.

OAuth serves to provide additional security over basic authentication if you'd
like to give out more advanced / restricted access to your developers.

Typically, if you're building a REST API, and aren't sure which form of
authentication to offer -- it's a much better idea to simply use basic
authentication (*covered in the previous section*).

If you'd still like to use OAuth, continue reading!


Configuring OAuth Token Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This library comes with OAuth support out-of-the box.  There are two
configuration options you can specify when initializing the Stormpath middleware
which control your OAuth flow:

- ``getOauthTokenUrl`` - The URL at which OAuth tokens can be retrieved.
  Defaults to ``/oauth``.
- ``oauthTTL`` - The amount of time (*in seconds*) that OAuth tokens last.
  Defaults to ``3600`` (*one hour*).

Here's an example of how to set both of these attributes::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      getOauthTokenUrl: '/oauth',
      oauthTTL: 3600,
    }));


Getting an OAuth Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you've configured your OAuth settings, developers will be able to
retrieve OAuth tokens by hitting your OAuth URL (*/oauth by default*) with
their API credentials.

Below is an example request using curl, which demonstrates the proper way to
request an OAuth token::

    $ curl -v --user id:secret http://localhost:3000/oauth?grant_type=client_credentials
    {"access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJEUExSSTVUTEVNMjFTQzNER0xHUjBJOFpYIiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuc3Rvcm1wYXRoLmNvbS92MS9hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMvNWpvQVVKdFZONHNkT3dUVVJEc0VDNSIsImlhdCI6MTQwNjY1OTkxMCwiZXhwIjoxNDA2NjYzNTEwLCJzY29wZSI6IiJ9.ypDMDMMCRCtDhWPMMc9l_Q-O-rj5LATalHYa3droYkY","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":3600}

.. note::
    If you're wondering why the ``?grant_type=client_credentials`` querystring
    exists -- it's part of the OAuth spec: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749

The response is a JSON object which contains:

- ``access_token`` - Your OAuth access token.  This can be used to authenticate
  via subsequent requests.
- ``token_type`` - This will always be ``'bearer'``.
- ``expires_in`` - This is the amount of seconds (*as an integer*) for which
  this token is valid.


Making OAuth Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you've got an OAuth access token, you can use this to make API requests
securely to you REST API.

Let's say you've defined the following API endpoint::

    // This API endpoint is *only* accessible to users with a valid OAuth token.
    app.get('/me', stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired, function(req, res) {
      var user = req.user;
      res.json({
        givenName: user.givenName,
        surname: user.surname,
        email: user.email,
      });

By using the ``stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired`` middleware, users will be
authenticated automatically on your behalf.

Here's a sample curl request to this endpoint without any credentials::

    $ curl -v http://localhost:3000/me
    {"error":"Invalid API credentials."}

And here's a sample curl request to this endpoint with the Bearer token
included::

    $ curl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJEUExSSTVUTEVNMjFTQzNER0xHUjBJOFpYIiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuc3Rvcm1wYXRoLmNvbS92MS9hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMvNWpvQVVKdFZONHNkT3dUVVJEc0VDNSIsImlhdCI6MTQwNjY1OTkxMCwiZXhwIjoxNDA2NjYzNTEwLCJzY29wZSI6IiJ9.ypDMDMMCRCtDhWPMMc9l_Q-O-rj5LATalHYa3droYkY' http://localhost:3000/me
    {"givenName":"Randall","surname":"Degges","email":"r@rdegges.com"}

As you can see, by correctly specifying your OAuth token, you're able to
authenticate against the API endpoint easily!


Customize Redirect Logic
------------------------

As you might have already noticed by playing around with the registration and
login pages -- when you first register or log into an account, you'll be
immediately redirected to the URL ``/``.

This is actually a configurable setting -- you can easily modify this default
redirect URL by adding the following config setting::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      redirectUrl: '/dashboard',
    }));

This allows you to build nicer apps as you can do stuff like redirect newly
registered users to a tutorial, dashboard, or something similar.

What if someone visits the login route when they are logged in?  By default
they will see the login screen again, but, but enabling the ``enableAutoLogin``
feature, users who are already logged in will be automatically redirected to
your ``redirectUrl`` -- skipping the login page all together::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableAutoLogin: true,
    }));

.. note::
    If a user visits a page which has restricted access, they'll be redirected
    to the login page.  Once the user logs in, they'll be immediately redirected
    back to whatever page they were initially trying to access (*this behavior
    overrides the ``redirectUrl`` setting*).


Customize User Registration Fields
----------------------------------

In many cases you might want to change the fields you collect when a user
registers.  Let's customize the fields we ask for when a user registers!

Every user you register ends up getting stored in Stormpath as an `Account`_
object.  Accounts in Stormpath have several fields you can set:

- username
- email (**required**)
- password (**required**)
- givenName (**required**) also known as "first name"
- middleName
- surname (**required**) also known as "last name"

By default, the built-in registration view that Express-Stormpath ships with gets
you a registration page that looks like this:

.. image:: /_static/registration-page.png

As you can see, it includes the ``givenName``, ``middleName``, ``surname``,
``email``, and ``password`` fields by default.  All of these fields are
required, with the exception of ``middleName``.

What happens if a user enters an invalid value -- or leaves a required field
blank?  They'll see something like this:

.. image:: /_static/registration-page-error.png

But what if you want to force the user to enter a value for middle name?  Doing
so is easy!  Express-Stormpath is **highly customizable**, and allows you to
easily control which fields are accepted, and which fields are required.

To require a user to enter a middle name field, set the following value in your
Express app config::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableMiddleName: true,
      requireMiddleName: true,
    }));

Now go ahead and give it a try -- if you attempt to create a new user and don't
specify a middle name, you'll see an error!

.. note::
    Each Stormpath field allows you to specify two config values:
    ``enableFieldName`` and ``requireFieldName``.  The ``enableXXX`` setting
    controls whether or not the specified field is displayed on the registration
    page -- the ``requireXXX`` field controls whether or not the specified field
    is required by the user to successfully complete the registration process.

Lastly, it's also simple to add in a ``username`` field (*either required or
optional*).  Just like the examples above, you can use the ``enable`` and
``require`` settings to control the registration behavior::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableUsername: true,
      requireUsername: true,
    }));

And that's it!


Customize User Login Fields
---------------------------

If you visit your login page (``/login``), you will see (*by default*), two
input boxes: one for ``email`` and one for ``password``.

While this is fine for most purposes, sometimes you might want to let users log
in with a ``username`` **or** ``email`` (especially if your site collects
``username`` during registration).

Doing this is simple: by enabling the ``enableUsername`` setting you'll not
only make the ``username`` field available on the registration page,
but also on the login page (*so users can log in by entering either their
``username`` or ``email`` and ``password``*).

To enable ``username`` support, just set the following config variable::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableUsername: true,
    }));

You should now see the following on your login page:

.. image:: /_static/login-page.png

.. note::
    In the example above we didn't set the ``requireUsername`` field
    to ``true`` -- if we did, this would ensure that when a new user registers
    for the site, they **must** pick a ``username``.

    The ``requireUsername`` field has no effect on the login page.


Customize User Registration, Login, and Logout Routes
-----------------------------------------------------

By default, Express-Stormpath automatically enables three separate views and
routes:

- ``/register`` - the registration view
- ``/login`` - the login view
- ``/logout`` - the logout view

Customizing the built-in URL routes is quite simple.  There are several config
variables you can change to control these URL mappings.  To change them, just
modify your app's config.

- ``registrationUrl`` -- default: ``/register``
- ``loginUrl`` -- default: ``/login``
- ``logoutUrl`` -- default: ``/logout``

If you were to modify your config such that::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      registrationUrl: '/welcome',
    }));

Then visit ``/welcome``, you'd see your registration page there, instead!


Custom Views & Routes
---------------------

Now that your website is fully functioning with login and registration,
you'll want to add your own pages to the site!  In Express these are
referred to as views that are served by routes.

You  need to tell Express which templating engine you'd like to use.
While we use Jade for the built-in views you are free to use your engine
of choice when creating your own pages.

Using Jade
..........

If you wish to use Jade, you'll need to add the Jade package to your project::

    npm install --save jade

Then declare this in your configuration::

    app.set('views', './views');
    app.set('view engine', 'jade');

With that you're good to go!  Going back to our previous example, let's say
we had a page that we wanted to serve at ``/secret``.  We'll create a file
``views/secret.jade`` and put this template in it::

    html
      head
        title=title
      body
        p Hello, #{user.username}
        p You are permitted to see the secrets

Then create a route handler for this page::

    app.get('/secret', stormpath.loginRequired, function(req, res) {
      res.render('secret', {
        title: 'Top Secret HQ'
      });
    });


Using EJS
.........

Jade not your thing?  No problem!  EJS is just as easy to configure.

Just install the package::

    npm install --save ejs

Then configure your app like this::

    app.set('views', './views');
    app.engine('html', require('ejs').renderFile);
    app.set('view engine', 'html');

EJS uses HTML, so your file will now be named ``views/secret.html`` and will
look like this::

    <html>
      <head>
        <title><%= title %></title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Hello, <%= user.username %></p>
        <p>You are permitted to see the secrets</p>
      </body>
    </html>

The route handler will look exactly the same as the Jade example above.  That
is the beauty of the templating layer in Express!


Customize the Built-in Views
----------------------------

Although I personally find our registration and login pages to be incredibly
good looking -- I realize that you might not share my same design passion!

Express-Stormpath was built with customizability in mind, and makes it very easy
to build your own custom registration and login views.

Let's start by looking at the built-in views:
https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-express/tree/master/lib/views

Here's a quick rundown of what each template is for:

- ``base.jade`` is the base template that the registration and login templates
  extend.  It provides a basic `bootstrap`_ based layout, with a couple of
  blocks for customizing the child templates.
- ``login.jade`` is the login page.  It has some logic to flash error messages
  to the user if something fails, and also dynamically determines which input
  boxes to display based on the app's settings.
- ``register.jade`` is the registration page.  It has some logic to flash error
  messages to the user if something fails, and also dynamically determines
  which input boxes to display based on the app's settings.

If you're comfortable with `Jade`_, you can copy these templates to your
project directly, and customize them yourself.  If you're not already a super
Express guru, continue reading!


The Most Basic View
...................

Let's say you want to build your own, fully customized registration and login
views -- no problem!

The first thing you need to do is create two views in the ``views``
directory of your project.

First, copy the following code into ``views/register.jade``::

    // Display an error if there is any.
    if error
      p #{error}

    form(method='post')
      input(name='_csrf', type='hidden', value=csrfToken)

      // This block of code renders the desired input boxes for registering users.
      if app.get('stormpathEnableUsername')
        input(placeholder='Username', name='username', required=app.get('stormpathRequireUsername') ? true : false, type='text')

      if app.get('stormpathEnableGivenName')
        input(placeholder='First Name', name='givenName', required=app.get('stormpathRequireGivenName') ? true : false, type='text')

      if app.get('stormpathEnableMiddleName')
        input(placeholder='Middle Name', name='middleName', required=app.get('stormpathRequireMiddleName') ? true : false, type='text')

      if app.get('stormpathEnableSurname')
        input(placeholder='Last Name', name='surname', required=app.get('stormpathRequireSurname') ? true : false, type='text')

      input(placeholder='Email', name='email', required='true', type='text')
      input(placeholder='Password', name='password', required='true', type='password')

      button(type='submit') Create Account

The simple template you see above is the most basic possible registration page.
It renders all of the appropriate input forms, based on your settings.

Next, copy the following code into ``views/login.jade``::

    // Display an error if there is any.
    if error
      p #{error}

    form(method='post')
      input(name='_csrf', type='hidden', value=csrfToken)

      if app.get('stormpathEnableUsername')
        input(placeholder='Username or Email', required=true, name='login', type='text')
      else
        input(placeholder='Email', required=true, name='login', type='text')

      input(placeholder='Password', required=true, type='password', name='password')
      button(type='submit') Log In

This is the most basic login template possible.


Update Template Paths
.....................

Now that you've got the simplest possible templates ready to go, let's activate
them!  In your app's config, you'll need to specify the path to your new
templates like so::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      registrationView: __dirname + '/views/register.jade',
      loginView: __dirname + '/views/login.jade',
    }));

That will tell Express-Stormpath to render the templates you created above instead
of the built-in ones!

Now, if you open your browser and checkout ``/register`` and ``/login``, you
should see something like the following:

.. image:: /_static/registration-page-basic.png

.. image:: /_static/login-page-basic.png

**BAM!**  That wasn't so bad, was it?  You now have your own customized
registration and login templates -- all you need to do now is design them the
way you want!


Disable the Built-in Views
--------------------------

If for some reason you want to write your own registration, login, and logout
views (*not recommended*), you can easily disable all of the automatic
functionality described above by modifying your app config and adding the
following::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableRegistration: false,
      enableLogin: false,
      enableLogout: false,
    }));


Passing Extra Variables to the Built-in Templates
-------------------------------------------------

If you've started to customize the base Stormpath templates that render the
registration and login pages (*as well as many others*), you might have been
wondering how you can pass extra information into each template -- stuff like
your Google Analytics tracking code, social sharing stuff, etc.

As of Express-Stormpath **0.4.9**, you're now able to define a JSON object that
will be automatically available to all of the Stormpath templates!

The way this works is simple.

Firstly, you can you specify your template variables during the middleware
initialization process or via an environment variable::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      templateContext: {
        googleAnalyticsCode: 'UA-XXX-XX',
        intercomId: 'xxx',
      },
    }));

Or, if you prefer environment variables::

    $ export STORMPATH_TEMPLATE_CONTEXT='{"googleAnalyticsCode": "UA-XXX-XX", "intercomId": "xxx"}'

Now that you've defined your variables, you can use them freely inside of your
customized Stormpath templates!  For example, if you wanted to customize the
built-in ``registration.jade`` template, you could create a new Jade file that
looks like this::

    html
      body
        script(type="text/javascript").
          (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
          (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
          m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
          })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

          ga('create', '#{googleAnalyticsCode}', 'auto');
          ga('send', 'pageview');

See how the template above now has the Google Analytics Tracking code embedded
in it?  This is working because the ``#{googleAnalyticsCode}`` variable is being
made available to your templates automatically.

Lastly, in order to activate your new template, you need to activate it::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      registrationView: __dirname + '/views/register.jade',
    }))

Once you've done that, you'll be good to go!


Use Account Verification
------------------------

As of Express-Stormpath **0.1.8**, it is now possible to easily enable an
"Account Verification Workflow", which makes newly registered users click a link
in in their email inbox before completing user the user registration process.

If you'd like to ensure your users are registering with legitimate email
addresses, this feature makes the process as painless as possible =)


Configure the Workflow
......................

The first thing you need to do to enable "Account Verification" functionality
in your Express app is visit the `Directory Dashboard`_ and select your default
user directory.

Next, you should see several options in a tab.  You will want to click the
"Workflows" button.  Once you've landed on this page, you'll then want to click
the "show" link to the right of the "Account Registration and Verification"
header.  This section allows you to configure your "Account Verification"
settings.

On this page, the only thing you **need** to change is the "Account Verification
Base URL" setting at the top.  You need to set this to be:
``https://mysite.com/verified``, substituting in your own website address.

For instance, if your site lives at ``https://www.mysite.com``, you'll want to
set "Account Verification Base URL" to ``https://www.mysite.com/verified``.

This URL determines where a user will be redirected after clicking the
verification link in the email we send them.  If you're testing things out
locally, you can also set this to a local URL (eg:
``http://localhost:3000/verified``).

After setting "Account Verification Base URL", you can also adjust any of the
other settings below -- you can customize the email templates that are used to
email the user, and a variety of other options.

When you're finished customizing the "Account Verification Workflow", be sure
to hit the "Update" button at the bottom of the page.


Enable Account Verification in Your App
.......................................

Now that you've configured the "Account Verification" settings on Stormpath's
side, you need to configure your Express application to enable account
verification.

You can do this easily by modifying your application config like so::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableAccountVerification: true,
    }));

And...  That's all you have to do!


Test it Out
...........

Now that you've fully enabled account verification functionality in your app,
open up the registration page in your Express app and check it out!  After
creating a new user account, you'll be greeted by a message informing you that
before you can continue you need to click the verification link in your inbox.
This page looks like this:

.. image:: /_static/verification.png

Then, depending on your "Account Verification Workflow" configuration, the user
will see an email that looks like the following:

.. image:: /_static/verification-email.png

When a user clicks the link in their email, they'll reach a success page that
looks like this:

.. image:: /_static/verification-complete.png

And lastly, once a user clicks the verification link, they'll be automatically
logged into their account, then redirected to the main page of your site
(whatever URL is set as ``redirectUrl`` in your configuration).  They'll also
be shown this page for a few seconds to let them know the change was successful.

Not bad, right?


Customization
.............

Much like all other Express-Stormpath features, the account verification feature is
completely customizable.

You can easily change the account verification templates by modifying the following
configuration variables, respectively:

- ``stormpathAccountVerificationEmailSentView`` - The view which is shown after
  a new user creates an account.
- ``stormpathAccountVerificationCompleteView`` - The view which is shown after
  a user clicks the verification link in their email.

If you'd like to override the default views, you should take a look at the
ones included with Express-Stormpath here:
https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-express/tree/master/lib/views
and use these as a base for your own views.


Use Password Reset
------------------

As of Express-Stormpath **0.1.6**, it is now possible to easily enable a "Password
Reset Workflow", which allows your users to reset their passwords automatically.

We highly encourage you to use this feature, as it provides a simple and secure
way to allow your users to reset their passwords without hassle.


Configure the Workflow
......................

The first thing you need to do to enable "Password Reset" functionality in your
Express app is visit the `Directory Dashboard`_ and select your default user
directory.

Next, you should see several options in a tab.  You will want to click the
"Workflows" button.  Once you've landed on this page, you'll then want to click
the "show" link to the right of the "Password Reset" header.  This section
allows you to configure your "Password Reset" settings.

On this page, the only thing you **need** to change is the "Base URL" setting at
the top.  You need to set this to be: ``https://mysite.com/forgot/change``,
substituting in your own website address.

For instance, if your site lives at ``https://www.mysite.com``, you'll want to
set "Base URL" to ``https://www.mysite.com/forgot/change``.

This URL determines where a user will be redirected after attempting to reset
their password on your website.  If you're testing things out locally, you can
also set this to a local URL (eg: ``http://localhost:3000/forgot/change``).

After setting "Base URL", you can also adjust any of the other settings below --
you can customize the email templates that are used to email the user, and a
variety of other options.

When you're finished customizing the "Password Reset Workflow", be sure to hit
the "Update" button at the bottom of the page.


Enable Password Reset in Your App
.................................

Now that you've configured the "Password Reset" settings on Stormpath's side,
you need to configure your Express application to enable password reset.

You can do this easily by modifying your application config like so::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableForgotPassword: true,
    }));

And...  That's all you have to do!


Test it Out
...........

Now that you've fully enabled password reset functionality in your app, open up
the login page in your Express app and check it out!  You should see a "Forgot
Password?" link below the login form which looks like this:

.. image:: /_static/forgot.png

If you click the "Forgot Password?" link, you'll be brought to a password reset
page that looks like this:

.. image:: /_static/forgot-init.png

After filling in their email address, a user will see the following page:

.. image:: /_static/forgot-email-sent.png

Then, depending on your "Password Reset Workflow" configuration, the user will
see an email that looks like the following:

.. image:: /_static/forgot-email.png

When a user clicks the link in their email, they'll reach a password change page
that looks like this:

.. image:: /_static/forgot-change.png

And lastly, once a user changes their password successfully, they'll be
automatically logged into their account, then redirected to the main page of
your site (whatever URL is set as ``redirectUrl`` in your configuration).
They'll also be shown this page for a few seconds to let them know the change
was successful:

.. image:: /_static/forgot-complete.png

Not bad, right?


Customization
.............

Much like all other Express-Stormpath features, the password reset feature is
completely customizable.

You can easily change the password reset templates by modifying the following
configuration variables, respectively:

- ``forgotPasswordView`` - The view which is shown when a user clicks the
  "Forgot Password?" link on the login page.
- ``forgotPasswordEmailSentView`` - The view which is shown after a user
  has successfully requested a password reset.
- ``forgotPasswordChangeView`` - The view which is shown to a user after
  they've clicked the link in their email.  This view allows the user to
  change their password.
- ``forgotPasswordCompleteView`` - The view which is shown after the user has
  successfully reset their account password.
- ``enableForgotPasswordChangeAutoLogin`` - This setting determines whether or
  not you want a user who has just changed their password to be automatically
  logged into their account or not.  The default behavior is to log the user out
  and force them to re-authenticate manually.

If you'd like to override the default views, you should take a look at the
ones included with Express-Stormpath here:
https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-express/tree/master/lib/views
and use these as a base for your own views.


Use Facebook Login
------------------

Now that we've covered the basics: let's add Facebook Login support to your app!
Stormpath makes it very easy to support social login with Facebook.

In the next few minutes I'll walk you through *everything* you need to know to
support Facebook login with your app.


Create a Facebook App
.....................

The first thing you need to do is log into the `Facebook Developer Site`_ and
create a new Facebook App.

You can do this by visiting the `Facebook Developer Site`_ and click the "Apps"
menu at the top of the screen, then select the "Create a New App" button.  You
should see something like the following:

.. image:: /_static/facebook-new-project.png

Go ahead and pick a "Display Name" (usually the name of your app), and choose a
category for your app.  Once you've done this, click the "Create App" button.


Specify Allowed URLs
....................

The next thing we need to do is tell Facebook what URLs we'll be using Facebook
Login from.

From the app dashboard page you're on, click the "Settings" tab in the left
menu, then click the "Add Platform" button near the bottom of the page.  When
prompted, select "Website" as your platform type.

In the "Site URL" box, enter your private and public root URLs.  This should be
something like ``"http://localhost:3000"`` or ``"http://mysite.com"``.  *If you
want to allow Facebook Login from multiple URLs (local development, production,
etc.) you can just click the "Add Platform" button again and enter another URL.*

Lastly, click the "Save Changes" button to save the changes.

Your settings should now look something like this:

.. image:: /_static/facebook-url-settings.png


Create a Facebook Directory
...........................

Next, we need to input the Facebook app credentials into Stormpath.  This allows
Stormpath to interact with the Facebook API on your behalf, which automates all
OAuth flows.

To do this, you need to visit the `Directory dashboard`_ and create a new
directory.  When you click the "Create Directory" button, click the "Facebook"
button, then on the following screen enter your Facebook app information:

- For the "Name" field, you can insert whatever name you want.
- For the "Facebook Client ID" field, insert your Facebook App ID which you got
  in the previous steps.
- For the "Facebook Client Secret" field, insert your Facebook Client Secret
  which you got in the previous steps.

Lastly, be sure to click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

Next, you need to hook your new Facebook Directory up to your Stormpath
Application.  To do this, visit the `Application dashboard`_ and select your
Application from the list.

On your Application page, click the "Account Stores" tab, then click the "Add
Account Store" button.  From the drop down list, select your newly created
Facebook Directory, then save your changes.

That's it!


Configure Your Express App
..........................

Now that we've created a new Facebook App and configured our URLs -- we need to
enter our Facebook App secrets into our Express app so that express-stormpath
knows about them.

You can find your Facebook App ID and Secret on your App dashboard page, at the
top of the screen.

In your app's config, you'll want to add the following settings (*don't forget
to substitute in the proper credentials!*)::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableFacebook: true,
      social: {
        facebook: {
          appId: 'xxx',
          appSecret: 'xxx',
        },
      },
    }));

These two settings: ``enableFacebook`` and ``social`` work together to tell
express-stormpath to enable social login support for Facebook, as well as
provide the proper credentials so things work as expected.

.. note::
    We recommend storing your credentials in environment variables.  Please
    don't hard code secret credentials into your source code!


Test it Out
...........

Now that you've plugged your Facebook credentials into express-stormpath, social
login should already be working!

Open your express app in a browser, and try logging in by visiting the login page
(``/login``).  If you're using the default login page included with this
library, you should see the following:

.. image:: /_static/login-page-facebook.png

You now have a fancy new Facebook enabled login button!  Try logging in!  When
you click the new Facebook button you'll be redirected to Facebook, and
prompted to accept the permissions requested:

.. image:: /_static/login-page-facebook-permissions.png

After accepting permissions, you'll be immediately redirected back to your
website at the URL specified by ``redirectUrl`` in your app's config.

Simple, right?!


Use Google Login
----------------

Google Login is incredibly popular -- let's enable it!

In the next few minutes I'll walk you through *everything* you need to know to
support Google login with your app.


Create a Google Project
.......................

The first thing you need to do is log into the `Google Developer Console`_ and
create a new Google Project.

You can do this by visiting the `Developer Console`_ and clicking the "Create
Project" button.  You should see something like the following:

.. image:: /_static/google-new-project.png

Go ahead and pick a "Project Name" (usually the name of your app), and
(*optionally*) a "Project ID".


Enable Google Login
...................

Now that you've got a Google Project -- let's enable Google Login.  The way
Google Projects work is that you have to selectively enable what functionality
each Project needs.

From your `Console Dashboard`_ click on your new Project, then in the side panel
click on the "APIs & auth" menu option.

Now, scroll through the API list until you see "Google+ API", then click the
"OFF" button next to it to enable it.  You should now see the "Google+ API" as
"ON" in your API list:

.. image:: /_static/google-enable-login.png


Create OAuth Credentials
........................

The next thing we need to do is create a new OAuth client ID.  This is what
we'll use to handle user login with Google.

From your `Console Dashboard`_ click the "APIs & auth" menu, then click on the
"Credentials" sub-menu.

You should see a big red button labeled "Create New Client ID" near the top of
the page -- click that.

You'll want to do several things here:

1. Select "Web application" for your "Application Type".
2. Remove everything from the "Authorized Javascript Origins" box.
3. Add the URL of your site (both publicly and locally) into the "Authorized
   Redirect URI" box, with the ``/google`` suffix.  This tells Google where to
   redirect users after they've logged in with Google.

In the end, your settings should look like this:

.. image:: /_static/google-oauth-settings.png

Once you've specified your settings, go ahead and click the "Create Client ID"
button.

Lastly, you'll want to take note of your "Client ID" and "Client Secret"
variables that should now be displayed on-screen.  We'll need these in the next
step.


Create a Google Directory
.........................

Next, we need to input the Google app credentials into Stormpath.  This allows
Stormpath to interact with the Google API on your behalf, which automates all
OAuth flows.

To do this, you need to visit the `Directory dashboard`_ and create a new
directory.  When you click the "Create Directory" button, click the "Google"
button, then on the following screen enter your Google app information:

- For the "Name" field, you can insert whatever name you want.
- For the "Google Client ID" field, insert your Google Client ID which you got
  in the previous steps.
- For the "Google Client Secret" field, insert your Google Client Secret
  which you got in the previous steps.
- For the "Google Authorized Redirect URI" field, insert your Google Redirect
  URL from the previous section. Be sure to *only enter the URI you're currently
  using*.  EG: If you're running your app in development mode, set it to your
  local URL, if you're running your app in production mode, set it to your
  production URL.

Lastly, be sure to click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

Next, you need to hook your new Google Directory up to your Stormpath
Application.  To do this, visit the `Application dashboard`_ and select your
Application from the list.

On your Application page, click the "Account Stores" tab, then click the "Add
Account Store" button.  From the drop down list, select your newly created
Google Directory, then save your changes.

That's it!


Configure Your Express App
..........................

Now that we've created a new Google Project and generated OAuth secrets -- we
can now enter these secrets into our Express app so that express-stormpath
knows about them.

In your app's config, you'll want to add the following settings (*don't forget
to substitute in the proper credentials!*)::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableGoogle: true,
      social: {
        google: {
          clientId: 'xxx',
          clientSecret: 'xxx',
        },
      },
    }));

These two settings: ``enableGoogle`` and ``social`` work together to tell
express-stormpath to enable social login support for Google, as well as provide
the proper credentials so things work as expected.

.. note::
    We recommend storing your credentials in environment variables.  Please
    don't hard code secret credentials into your source code!


Test it Out
...........

Now that you've plugged your Google credentials into express-stormpath, social
login should already be working!

Open your Express app in a browser, and try logging in by visiting the login page
(``/login``).  If you're using the default login page included with this
library, you should see the following:

.. image:: /_static/login-page-google.png

You now have a fancy new Google enabled login button!  Try logging in!  When you
click the new Google button you'll be redirected to Google, and prompted to
select your Google account:

.. image:: /_static/login-page-google-account.png

After selecting your account you'll then be prompted to accept any permissions,
then immediately redirected back to your website at the URL specified by
``redirectUrl`` in your app's settings.

Simple, right?!


Use Hosted Login
----------------

If you'd like to use Stormpath's new hosted login functionality (*known as ID
Site*), you can now do so using Express-Stormpath 0.2.2+!

Stormpath's ID Site functionality works as so:

- If a user wants to register for your web site, they'll be redirected to your
  ID site URL (*hosted by Stormpath*).  This can be something like:
  https://login.mysite.com

- Stormpath will then display a login / registration / forgot password page
  automatically, depending on what the user wants to do, allowing the user to
  register **without touching your Express application!**  These pages can be
  completely customized however you like, of course.

- Once Stormpath has registered or logged the user in, they'll be redirected
  back to a route on your Express app (*which defaults to /redirect*).  This
  route will then verify that the user was successfully logged in, and create a
  user session.

- Lastly, the user will be redirected back to whatever page on your site is
  configured as the ``redirectUrl`` (*this defaults to /*).

For more information on ID Site, please read the official documentation:
http://docs.stormpath.com/guides/using-id-site/


Enable ID Site
..............

The first step in getting hosted login working is enabling the ID Site
functionality on Stormpath.

To do this, you'll want to first visit your `ID Site dashboard`_.  This page is
where you can configure your hosted login functionality.

.. note::
    These instructions will only cover using the built-in hosted login site --
    if you'd like to customize your ID Site URL or theme, that will be covered
    later.

In the box labeled "Authorized Redirect URIs", enter your redirect URL -- this
should be set to something like: ``https://www.mysite.com/redirect``.  If you're
testing locally, you might want to set this to:
``http://localhost:3000/redirect``.

If you'd like to support *both* production and local environments, you can add
multiple URLs (*just click the "Add another" button and enter as many URLs as
you'd like*).

Lastly, make sure to click the "Update" button at the bottom of the page to save
your changes.

In the end, it should look something like this:

.. image:: /_static/id-site-settings.png


Configure Your Express App
..........................

Now that we've configured Stormpath properly, let's configure our Express app!

In your app's config, you'll want to add the following settings::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      enableIdSite: true,
    }));

This setting tells Express-Stormpath to use the hosted login functionality
instead of the built-in local authentication functionality.


Test it Out
...........

Now that you've configured hosted login, let's give it a test.

If you start your Express server, then visit either the login or registration
page (*/login or /registration, respectively*), you should be redirected to your
hosted login site on Stormpath, where you can either create or log into your
account.

Once you've logged in, you'll be redirected back to your application in a logged
in state!

Here's a screenshot of the login page to show you what the hosted login site
currently looks like:
