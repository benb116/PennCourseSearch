The course will be graded S/U. In order to obtain a satisfactory (S) grade, the student will need to attend more than 70% of the departmental seminars. Participation in the seminar course will be documented and recorded on the students transcript. In order to obtain their degree, doctoral students will be required to accumulate six seminar courses and MS candidates (beginning in the Fall 2001) two courses.

Engineering students gain design sensibilities and advanced mechatronics in the form of networked embedded processing and protocols for large scale actuation and sensing. Design students learn elementary mechatronics and design reactive architectures and work with engineering students to build them.
